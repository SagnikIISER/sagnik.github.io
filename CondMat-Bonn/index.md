**Title:** Absorbing State Transitions in Monitored Systems

**Speaker:**  Michael Kajan (AG Kroha)

**Abstract:** 


<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  

The generall description of non-equilibrium system in a QFT framework has been known for quite some time now [Keldysh 64, Schwinger 61, Feynman Vernon 63] but its application were rather limited due to computational cost and experimental relevance. In the last few decades interest was sparked again due to experimental advances in open and driven quantum system. We will give here an introduction to the framework of the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism in an Green function approach.

We focus on bosonic systems, which may show spontaneously broken symmetry requiring anself consistent approximation scheme. To this end we will introduce the 2-PI effective action [Cornwall, Jackiw, Tomboulis 74] [Berges 05]. As an example system we consider dye-molecules coupled to cavity photons using a slave-particle method, which has been used as impurity solver in heavy fermion systems for quite some time now [Coleman 84]. We show how their concept can be extended to a wide range of physical systems and implemented in an non-equilibrium framework.

**Title:** Absorbing State Transitions in Monitored Systems

**Speaker:**  Sagnik Ghosh (AG Luitz)

**Abstract:** 


<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  


In this talk I will start with briefly reviewing the recent literature on the phenomena of Measurement Induced Phase Transitions in Unitary systems punctuated with projection operators. The criticality in these systems is however only visible in particular trajectories and the ensemble averaged density matrix is featureless and often maximally scrambled. This makes their experimental realization exponentially difficult, as one ought to build an ensemble of the exact measurement realizations, dimensions of which scales exponentially, a problem which is formally known as post-selection. With these foundations, in the remainder I will discuss a last week Arxiv paper by Vedika Khemani et. al. that attempts to find an alternate absorbing criticality in the punctuated systems that does not suffer from post selection and hence is claimed to be a more suitable candidate for experimental realization.

**Title:** TMajorana edge-modes in a spinful particle conserving model

**Speaker:**   Dr. Franco Thomas Lisandrini (AG Kollath)

**Abstract:** 


<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  


Topologically protected edge states, such as Majorana edge modes, have attracted a lot of attention over the past. The interest in Majorana modes is motivated by curiosity to observe and understand these fundamental quasi-particles, but also by the key role such modes play in several quantum information protocols. One important model which covers Majorana zero modes was proposed by Kitaev in 2001. It consists of a single chain of spinless fermions where the number of fermions in the system is not conserved. In spinless systems, people found that ground states supporting Majorana edge modes are present also in particle-number conserving settings. In this talk we will show the presence of Majorana edge modes in an interacting fermionic ladder with spin in a number conserved setting. The main result of the present work is that the topological phase is robust for a finite region in the parameter space in the presence of interactions.

**Title:** The pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet: From finite to zero temperature

**Speaker:**  Robin Schaefer (MPI-PKS Dresden)

**Abstract:** 


<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  


Frustrated magnets realize exotic forms of quantum matter beyond conventional order. However, many questions remain unanswered due to a lack of controlled and unbiased methods to study frustration in three dimensions. While most established numerical techniques have limited applicability, approaches based on cluster expansions are promising alternatives revealing novel insights into an archetypal problem of frustrated magnetism in three dimensions: the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet. For the first time, we are able to unbiasedly resolve its thermodynamic quantities to a temperature far beyond the scale on which the Schottky anomaly occurs. The broad applicability of the numerical linked cluster algorithm allows for the systematic investigation of different spin-liquid candidate materials such as the Cerium-based pyrochlores Ce2Zr2O7 and Ce2Sn2O7.

Despite a similar chemical composition, the algorithm finds fundamental differences in their quantum mechanical nature by constraining their microscopic exchange parameters.

Zero temperature properties are even less accessible: Neither the nature of the ground state nor an estimate of its energy are known for the pyrochlore antiferromagnet. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations pushed to three dimensions provide the first reliable estimate of its ground-state energy and yield robust evidence for a spontaneous inversion symmetry breaking manifesting itself as an energy density difference on the tetrahedral sublattice. The symmetry-breaking tendency of the model is further observed in the presence of an external magnetic field where similar calculations suggest a stable 1/2-magnetization plateau. Continuing the investigation of low-energy states, we propose a new family  -- exponentially numerous in the linear system size -- of valence-bond crystals as potential ground states. Understanding the stability of the previously overlooked family of states suggests a remarkable change of perspective on frustration with a focus on unfrustrated motifs, which are effectively uncoupled by the frustration. They can be visualized as hard-hexagon coverings, with each hexagon representing a resonating valence-bond ring breaking rotation, inversion, and translation symmetries spontaneously.

**Title:** Bringing the power of Monte Carlo methods to long-range-interacting molecular systems

**Speaker:**  Philipp HÃ¶llmer (AG Monien)

**Abstract:** 


<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  
Molecular simulations are widespread in molecular sciences to study, e.g., protein folding. Here, chemical systems are modeled empirically by a set of atomic positions with parameterized interaction potentials. Nowadays, molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations are predominantly used to study long-range-interacting molecular systems because of their superior computational complexities and Newtonian dynamics when compared to traditional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We argue that both disadvantages of traditional reversible MCMC are overcome by event-chain Monte Carlo (ECMC), which is a family of non-reversible MCMC methods.

In this talk, we will explore how ECMC samples the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution exactly, although it uses non-equilibrium dynamics and never computes the total system potential. We will discuss how ECMC's sole restriction of the global-balance condition yields a great freedom to implement quickly decorrelating dynamics beyond Newtonian's dynamics of MD. This freedom is evidenced by various variants of ECMC that show widely different performances depending on the specific use case. Finally, we will demonstrate O(N log N) scaling for ECMC's decorrelation of an N-body system of a commonly used long-range-interacting water model. This matches the performance of MD without ever discretizing time or space.

**Title:** Superfluid transport through a dissipative quantum point contact

**Speaker:**  Dr Anne-Maria Johanna Visuri (AG Kollath)

**Abstract:** 

<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  
We study theoretically and experimentally the superfluid transport of ultracold fermionic atoms through a quantum point contact with a local particle loss. In the absence of losses, superconducting contacts are known to exhibit multiple Andreev reflections - a high-order cotunneling of a quasiparticle together with multiple Cooper pairs - which gives rise to a current at chemical potential biases below the energy gap. We develop a model the lossy quantum point contact where the superfluid reservoirs are connected via tunneling to a dissipative site, and interactions are taken into account in a mean-field approximation. We compute nonequilibrium observables using the Keldysh formalism and find that the current generated by the seemingly delicate high-order tunneling process is surprisingly robust to particle losses. This result  agrees with experimental data: we apply a pair-breaking, spin-dependent dissipation at the contact and observe that the characteristic non-Ohmic superfluid transport survives even at dissipation strength larger than the superfluid gap [1].

**Title:** Interacting spins under quasiperiodic drive

**Speaker:** Dr. Sayak Ray (AG Kroha)

**Abstract:** 

<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  
In this talk, I will discuss the dynamics of a system subjected to quasiperiodic drive. As a toy model, I will consider a spin-S object subjected to \delta-function kicks which are applied in the transverse direction of the magnetic field and generated from a Fibonacci sequence. In the large spin classical limit, the phase space appears to be chaotic; interestingly, however, the Lyapunov exponent turns out to be zero and thus the dynamics remain phase-coherent. I will show that such dynamics are similar to a strange non-chaotic attractor with fractal nature which is also present in the Floquet eigenstates. Interaction with another spin results in ergodic dynamics leading to infinite temperature thermalization.

**Title:** Heavy-Fermion Systems and Some Exotic Examples 

**Speaker:** Marvin Lenk (AG Kroha)

**Abstract:**
<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  
In this talk I will discuss the physics of heavy-fermion systems and my current research in this field, including topological systems and exotic effects in this category. Starting from simple concepts in condensed matter theory and quantum mechanics, I will briefly explain the origin of the Kondo effect and how heavy Kondo-bands can form in real-world alloys. In that context, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and the non-crossing approximation (NCA) will be briefly discussed as methods to numerically solve such systems. Finally, I will present results of applying these methods to solve bulk topological Kondo-insulators like SmB6 and the quadrupolar two-channel Kondo effect in PrV2Al20.
