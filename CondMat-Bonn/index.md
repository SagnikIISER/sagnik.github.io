**Title:** Superfluid transport through a dissipative quantum point contact

**Speaker:**  Dr Anne-Maria Johanna Visuri (AG Kollath)

**Abstract:** 

<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  
We study theoretically and experimentally the superfluid transport of ultracold fermionic atoms through a quantum point contact with a local particle loss. In the absence of losses, superconducting contacts are known to exhibit multiple Andreev reflections - a high-order cotunneling of a quasiparticle together with multiple Cooper pairs - which gives rise to a current at chemical potential biases below the energy gap. We develop a model the lossy quantum point contact where the superfluid reservoirs are connected via tunneling to a dissipative site, and interactions are taken into account in a mean-field approximation. We compute nonequilibrium observables using the Keldysh formalism and find that the current generated by the seemingly delicate high-order tunneling process is surprisingly robust to particle losses. This result  agrees with experimental data: we apply a pair-breaking, spin-dependent dissipation at the contact and observe that the characteristic non-Ohmic superfluid transport survives even at dissipation strength larger than the superfluid gap [1].

**Title:** Bringing the power of Monte Carlo methods to long-range-interacting molecular systems

**Speaker:**  Philipp HÃ¶llmer (AG Monien)

**Abstract:** 


<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  
Molecular simulations are widespread in molecular sciences to study, e.g., protein folding. Here, chemical systems are modeled empirically by a set of atomic positions with parameterized interaction potentials. Nowadays, molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations are predominantly used to study long-range-interacting molecular systems because of their superior computational complexities and Newtonian dynamics when compared to traditional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We argue that both disadvantages of traditional reversible MCMC are overcome by event-chain Monte Carlo (ECMC), which is a family of non-reversible MCMC methods.

In this talk, we will explore how ECMC samples the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution exactly, although it uses non-equilibrium dynamics and never computes the total system potential. We will discuss how ECMC's sole restriction of the global-balance condition yields a great freedom to implement quickly decorrelating dynamics beyond Newtonian's dynamics of MD. This freedom is evidenced by various variants of ECMC that show widely different performances depending on the specific use case. Finally, we will demonstrate O(N log N) scaling for ECMC's decorrelation of an N-body system of a commonly used long-range-interacting water model. This matches the performance of MD without ever discretizing time or space.

**Title:** Interacting spins under quasiperiodic drive

**Speaker:** Dr. Sayak Ray (AG Kroha)

**Abstract:** 

<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  
In this talk, I will discuss the dynamics of a system subjected to quasiperiodic drive. As a toy model, I will consider a spin-S object subjected to \delta-function kicks which are applied in the transverse direction of the magnetic field and generated from a Fibonacci sequence. In the large spin classical limit, the phase space appears to be chaotic; interestingly, however, the Lyapunov exponent turns out to be zero and thus the dynamics remain phase-coherent. I will show that such dynamics are similar to a strange non-chaotic attractor with fractal nature which is also present in the Floquet eigenstates. Interaction with another spin results in ergodic dynamics leading to infinite temperature thermalization.

**Title:** Heavy-Fermion Systems and Some Exotic Examples 

**Speaker:** Marvin Lenk (AG Kroha)

**Abstract:**
<details open>
<summary></summary>
<br>  
In this talk I will discuss the physics of heavy-fermion systems and my current research in this field, including topological systems and exotic effects in this category. Starting from simple concepts in condensed matter theory and quantum mechanics, I will briefly explain the origin of the Kondo effect and how heavy Kondo-bands can form in real-world alloys. In that context, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and the non-crossing approximation (NCA) will be briefly discussed as methods to numerically solve such systems. Finally, I will present results of applying these methods to solve bulk topological Kondo-insulators like SmB6 and the quadrupolar two-channel Kondo effect in PrV2Al20.
