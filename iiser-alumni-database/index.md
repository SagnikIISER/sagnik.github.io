# The Pan IISER Alumni Database

Hey! Fellow IISERites!

So from some discussion in the IISER wide alumni group in Europe it was felt like it will be useful to have a database of alumni's in some form. So this initiative was made. 

Here is the attempt to create an IISER wide alumni database spread across the globe. 


**Caution:**

This page is still being updated from backend. Page may look very different on return. Some Links may malfunction.


**Note:** This initiative is extremely unofficial and completely voluntary. Data is only shared with people who wishes to take part in the same. Once you fill the form you will get a link to the map and an excel sheet containing all response. The excel sheet will never be made publicly available on the internet. 


The idea is to have a database, so that if you want are moving and want to see if someone is there in some city, to have the info!

 Happy Connecting! ðŸ˜ƒ
