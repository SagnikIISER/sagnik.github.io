# Rare Ragas of HCM 

This experiment of a blog is a humble attempt to create comprehensive playlists of _Bandishes (compositions)_, composed particularly in Ragas that are rather complex, rather rare or both! Hindusthani Classical Music can be thought of summation of distinct _Gharanas (A loose translation will be "schools")_, which are largely historical, and were formed around a Maestro, hosted by the Royal Court of some Princely State. In most cases the Gharana is thus also named after the Court (notable exceptions being _Bhindi Bazar_ and even _Jaipur_, which was actually formed around Ustad Alladiya Khan in the Royal Courts of _Kolhapur_.) 

Although all Gharanas come with their unique reportoire of styles (of both presentation and ornaments), compositions, rules and ragas, Jaipur artists in particular (contemporary and erstwhile) are especially famed about rarely performing ragas that are not rare on stage. Hence, (at least on the initial days) our list is very likely to be heavily biased towards Jaipur bandishes. Sincere efforts will however be made to be exhaustive of whatever is available on public domain! 


If not Gharana-wise too, We will very definitely follow a Raga-wise trajectory! Will we ever do an Artist-wise arrangement? We will see! The content is supposed to undergo regular update...

Stay Tuned!!
