Currently I am busy doing my MS Thesis at TIFR.
Earlier I have been NIUS Fellow at HBCSE (TIFR).
I mainly work in Condendesed Matter Physics, Quantum Information and Field Theories with a keen interest in Mathematical Aspects. 

You can have a look at my detailed Project Report at NIUS, where I have worked on reformuating Quantum Fluid Dynamics from the Path Integral formulation, [here](https://sagnikiiser.github.io/NIUS/NIUS_thesis.pdf).
