Currently I am busy doing my MS Thesis at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research [(TIFR)](https://www.tifr.res.in/), Mumbai.

Earlier I have been a [NIUS](https://nius.hbcse.tifr.res.in) Fellow at [HBCSE (TIFR)](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/).

I mainly work in Condendesed Matter Physics, Quantum Information and Field Theories with a keen interest in Mathematical Aspects. 

You can have a look at my detailed Project Report at NIUS, where I have worked on reformuating Quantum Fluid Dynamics from the Path Integral formulation, [here](https://sagnikiiser.github.io/NIUS/NIUS_thesis.pdf).
