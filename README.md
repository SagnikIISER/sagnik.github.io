Currently I am busy doing my MS Thesis at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research [(TIFR)](https://www.tifr.res.in/), Mumbai.

Earlier I have been a [NIUS](https://nius.hbcse.tifr.res.in) Fellow at [HBCSE (TIFR)](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/).

I mainly work in Condendesed Matter Physics, Quantum Information and Field Theories with a keen interest in Mathematical Aspects. 

You can have a look at my detailed [Project Report](https://sagnikiiser.github.io/NIUS/NIUS_thesis.pdf) at NIUS, where I have worked on reformuating Quantum Fluid Dynamics from the Path Integral formulation. 

*MS Thesis Proposal:*
The usual tex file provided (at least at our time) suffered from various allignment and bibliography incompatibility issues which forced many to choose the .txt alternative. I had attempted to fix these during the Lockdown 2020 to more faithfully reprodue its .txt analogue. 

Albeit being simple tweaks, several of my batchmates had found this template useful, so I am making it publicly available.

Here is a [sample output](https://sagnikiiser.github.io/MS%20Thesis%20Proposal/MS_Thesis_Proposal.pdf).

(The Body of the sample text is an exerpt from the Liner Notes to [_Final Report (1999)_](http://www.math.utah.edu/~ptrapa/finalreport/CD.html), an album by _Do Not Erase_, the only Rock Band ever formed at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.)

If you wish to fit in more text, change the classfile from _article_ to _amsart_.

Recently, I have been creating a manual to collate working knowledge of our in-house Supercomputer, Param-Brahma, which is usually passed on from generations to generations of students.
